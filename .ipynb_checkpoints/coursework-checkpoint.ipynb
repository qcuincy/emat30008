    "Numerical methods are an essential aspect of scientific computing, providing powerful tools to solve mathematical models and simulations that are too complex to solve analytically. Numerical methods are widely used in various fields of engineering, physics, and mathematics to obtain accurate and efficient solutions to a range of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software I have developed as part of my coursework is a general numerical continuation code that can track limit cycle oscillations of arbitrary ordinary differential equations and steady-states of second-order diffusive partial differential equations. The software is designed to be modular, following the DRY principle, and takes the form of a library, providing one or more functions that take the differential equation (either an ODE or PDE) in a suitable form, the parameter values, and a starting guess for the initial variable values (and period of oscillation if appropriate).\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall purpose of this software is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for researchers and practitioners in various fields to solve complex mathematical models and simulations. The software is fully tested against a range of inputs and known outputs, and inputs that do not have a solution are handled gracefully. Additionally, the code is appropriately documented, and examples of running the code for both ODEs and PDEs are provided, with no user input required when running the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the course, we have covered various topics related to numerical methods, such as initial value problems, numerical shooting, code testing, numerical continuation, finite difference methods, the method of lines, implicit methods for linear PDEs, implicit methods for nonlinear PDEs, and sparse linear algebra. The software I have developed takes into account all of these topics and integrates them into a single, powerful tool for solving complex mathematical models and simulations."

    "The aim of this coursework was to develop a Python package that can solve ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs) with both initial value problems (IVPs) and boundary value problems (BVPs). While existing packages such as `scipy` provide some functionality in this regard, the software has been designed to make the process of finding a solution to differential equations more straightforward and guided by automatically detecting the problem type (ODE vs PDE) based on the function arguments' length and identifying whether it is an IVP or BVP. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main `ProblemSolver` class forms the backbone of the software, with separate `IVP` and `BVP` classes to handle these two types of problems. The `Problem` class is used to set up the problem by defining the differential equation(s) and initial/boundary conditions, as well as any relevant parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem, the `solve()` method of the `ProblemSolver` class is called, which takes several optional arguments to customize the solver's behavior. The method argument determines the ODE solver method used, while `pde_method` is used to select the numerical method for solving PDEs. The `root_finder` argument selects the algorithm used to find roots in the BVP case, while `discretize_method`, `bc_type`, and `matrix_type` are used to customize the discretization method, boundary conditions, and matrix type for BVPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The software can handle various types of ODE and PDE problems, including stiff ODEs and systems of equations, as well as nonlinear PDEs. The software has been tested on a range of problems, including several weekly exercises from the labs, and have found that it provides accurate solutions with reasonable computational efficiency."
